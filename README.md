# Project Name: Task Creator Fintodo

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a application that would allow users to build a task list of things to do.

In this application, users can create the name of the task and describe it. Once all inputs are filled the user can click create to append a new task in a table.

Upon clicking the complete button, the task would switch from false to true and vise-versa.

This project has taught me a lot about how clients, servers and database communicated. 

The most difficult part was making sure I built simple code that made it easier for me to reference from client to server to datbase. 

The biggest issue I had was that I couldn't easily reference element attributes in the html or client file. This was about the only reason that made the Ajax request PUT difficult.

In the future I will make sure to make it easier to reference elements. I also need to learn new built-in functions so that I can reference easily.
